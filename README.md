# mom-server

mom-server is a simple and lightweight Http Server created without using any external libraries.

Mom Server comes with its own logger and Pojo configurations, but the same can be easily decoupled,
if you are interested in the server implementation only!

The same repo also contains a stubby sample app called *tickermaster* that demos integration with
the server.

Note: As of now the server is single threaded.
